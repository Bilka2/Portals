# Portals

Adds portals that can teleport players (and only players!). Build the portals using the portal gun: Left click for the orange portal, SHIFT+ Left click (ghost build) for the blue portal. Every player can have one set of portals which can be distinguished using the number next to the portal. Adds combustible lemons that work similiar to cluster grenades, just with fire. This mod can also be found on [the forums.](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=44305)

Known issues: The teleportation sound does not play for the player using the portal if the portals are on different surfaces. It does however play for any other player near the portals. This is an issue with the game, not the mod.
